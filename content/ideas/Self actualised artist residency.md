# Proposal
A week long artist residency with friends (self funded) a few hours from Sydney, where we can each focus on our own projects or collaborate as desired. Testing a theory of communal living and reconnection. 

I want to create a space for multi-disciplinary collaboration and exploration. I want to see organic themes emerge and works that couldn't have been made alone. I want everyone to feel safe and understood and free to express themselves and more connected to the people and world around them. 
## Structure
Each person sets their own schedule, however each day there will be a shared meal that everyone is expected to attend. Everyone is encouraged to rest, and explore their own relationship to time and space. If you feel awake and energetic at night, please stay up (but try not to disturb others who might be sleeping), similarly for early birds. 

Communal evening meals will be shared and everyone is expected to attend (or at least show their face). 

The last day will involve a "exhibition". Each person can choose to share their work from the week (or not), either by displaying, performing, projecting or reading their work (or any other medium possible). 
## The "art"
Everyone is free to decide what they want to create or explore in this time. You are not required to share what you're working on, however we aim to create a safe space where everyone should feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and work. We also encourage brainstorming and working together where possible/relevant. 

No critique unless directly asked for, and no beta-spraying (for lack of a better word) let everyone figure out their work at their own pace. 

Explorations in new mediums are encouraged, collaboration with others focussing on different mediums, and sharing of resources and ideas (with consent). 
## Details

### The space
An airbnb with access to either a body of water or natural landscape nearby without requiring a car. 

Each person has their own room (or shared room if desired) and communal space is available to everyone. Hopefully you will only be sleeping in the room so inequalities are simple to sort out. 

Communal kitchen and pantry, unless labelled (though all food is encouraged to be shared). 

Communal areas are encouraged to be quiet or thoughtful spaces unless agreed upon by everyone in them. Quiet is the default, music is welcome if agreed upon. 

### The "rules"
All house rules are agreed upon by the group, anyone can suggest rules but also anyone can veto them. To be determined on the first day and amended as required.

### Technology
Technology use is discouraged, however depending on the medium this is obviously not strict. The house internet will be turned off, and everyone is encouraged to leave their phones in a central location on do not disturb unless needed (obviously free to use/check in an emergency). 

### Meals
Each person is responsible for food for one evening meal, however can share responsibility with a group if desired (ie 2 people share cooking for 2 nights). 

Ingredients should be listed ahead of time to limit the amount of shopping required and to keep the focus on the craft. 

Other meals will be a fend for yourself type vibe, with communal foods available. Food should be simple and vegetarian. 

### Substances
Would prefer to keep this substance free, with the exception of exhibition night, which does not require substances, but may involved replicating a gallery opening type vibe with wine and cheese etc. 

### Funding
Expenses are split evenly as agreed upon by the group, except as individuals may decide for their own needs. (ie no purchasing expensive/extra items unless agreed upon by the group to share)
